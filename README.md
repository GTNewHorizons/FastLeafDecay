FastLeafDecay
=============
A simple Minecraft mod that speeds up leaf decay after you cut down the wood in a tree.

## Download
Download the source code from right here, or [get the jar version here](http://bit.ly/fastleafdecay10).

## Requirements
* Minecraft 1.7.10
* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) version 10.13.0.1199 or higher
 
Only servers need to have this mod, so if you're playing on a server that has it installed you will not need to install it on the client.

## Credits
[Lumien](https://github.com/lumien231) for making the Random Things mod. I took nearly all of the code for this mod from that one:
