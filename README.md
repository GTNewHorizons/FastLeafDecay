FastLeafDecay
=============
A simple Minecraft mod that speeds up leaf decay after you cut down the wood in a tree. Generally it will only take about five seconds before all leaves are gone.

## Download
Download the source code from right here, or get the jar version from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Olafski/FastLeafDecay/releases) or from [my website](http://bit.ly/fastleafdecay10).

## Discuss
Bug reports are welcome here on GitHub. Other discussion in the [MinecraftForum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2196219-fastleafdecay-leaves-be-gone) please.

## Requirements
* Minecraft 1.7.10
* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) version 10.13.0.1199 or higher
 
Only servers need to have this mod, so if you're playing on a server that has it installed you will not need to install it on the client.

## Known (compatibility) issues
This mod is probably not compatible with RandomThings, as they both modify the leaves block.

## Modpacks
Feel free to add this mod to your pack. No permission required! I would appreciate a line in [the MinecraftForum thread though](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2196219-fastleafdecay-leaves-be-gone).

## Credits
[Lumien](https://github.com/lumien231) for making the Random Things mod. I took nearly all of the code for this mod from that one:
